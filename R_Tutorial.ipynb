    "I’ve set this up as an introductory resource for psychology students taking my Programming with R class at UNSW. There are two goals with this resource. The first is to provide an introduction to R programming that doesn’t assume any previous experience. The second is to provide a brief sketch of some of things that R can be useful for in psychology. Data analysis inevitably forms a large part of this, but I hope to cover a broader range of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The content borrows from my introductory statistics lecture notes (Learning Statistics with R), but they’re not equivalent, and over time the two are likely to part ways. I wrote Learning Statistics with R to accompany an introductory statistics class and the intended audience for that book is a psychology student taking their first research methods class. This resource is a little different – it’s aimed at someone who has taken at least one research methods class and would like to learn how to use the R programming language in their own work.\n",

    "It is of course a work in progress, but I hope it is useful! Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you spot an error or find something confusing.\n",

    "# 1.4 Functions\n",
    "The symbols +, -, * and so on are examples of operators. As we’ve seen, you can do quite a lot of calculations just by using these operators. However, in order to do more advanced calculations (and later on, to do actual statistics), you’re going to need to start using functions.2 I’ll talk in more detail about functions and how they work later, but for now let’s just dive in and use a few. To get started, suppose I wanted to take the square root of 225. The square root, in case your high school maths is a bit rusty, is just the opposite of squaring a number. So, for instance, since “5 squared is 25” I can say that “5 is the square root of 25”. The usual notation for this is 25‾‾‾√=5, though sometimes you’ll also see it written like this 250.5=5. This second way of writing it is kind of useful to “remind” you of the mathematical fact that “square root of x” is actually the same as “raising x to the power of 0.5”. Personally, I’ve never found this to be terribly meaningful psychologically, though I have to admit it’s quite convenient mathematically. Anyway, it’s not important. What is important is that you remember what a square root is, since it’s kind of useful in statistics!\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the square root of 25, I can do it in my head pretty easily, since I memorised my multiplication tables when I was a kid. It gets harder when the numbers get bigger, and pretty much impossible if they’re not whole numbers. This is where something like R comes in very handy. Let’s say I wanted to calculate the square root of 225. There’s two ways I could do this using R. Firstly, since the square root of 255 is the same thing as raising 225 to the power of 0.5, I could use the power operator ^, just like we did earlier:"

    "When we use a function to do something, we generally refer to this as calling the function, and the values that we type into the function (there can be more than one) are referred to as the arguments of that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, the sqrt function doesn’t really give us any new functionality, since we already knew how to do square root calculations by using the power operator ^. However, there are lots of other functions in R: in fact, almost everything of interest that I’ll talk about in this book is an R function of some kind. For example, one function that comes in handy quite often is the absolute value function. Compared to the square root function, it’s extremely simple: it just converts negative numbers to positive numbers, and leaves positive numbers alone. Calculating absolute values in R is pretty easy, since R provides the abs function that you can use for this purpose. For instance:"
